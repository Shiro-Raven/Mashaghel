1) Run `mongod.exe` to start MongoDB. You can then either use Mongo Compass or `mongo.exe` terminal to check the documents.
2) Run `npm start` to start the back-end server.
3) Run `ng serve` to start the front-end application. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
 
## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
